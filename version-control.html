								<p style="padding-top: 0px" align="justify">In this article,
									we are going to look at the basic idea of a Version Control
									System, its need, and the pivotal role it plays in the field of
									Software Engineering Processes and Version Control Management
									best practices. Version control systems are a category of
									software tools that help a software team manage changes to
									source code over time. Version control software keeps track of
									every modification to the code in a special kind of database.
									If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and
									compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake
									while minimizing disruption to all team members.</p></li>

					<div class="col-lg-12 portfolio-info" style="padding-top: 0px">
						<p style="padding-top: 0px" align="justify">Source code is a
							precious asset whose value must be protected. It is a repository
							of invaluable knowledge and understanding about the problem
							domain that the developers have collected and refined over the
							period of years/decades. Version Control anticipates on
							protecting this precious information from both catastrophic
							events and casual degradation of human errors. Version Control
							manages changes to documents, computer programs, large websites,
							and other collections of information. Each revision is associated
							with a time-stamp and the person making the change. Revisions can
							be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.</p>



						<p style="padding-top: 0px" align="justify">Even though it is
							most often used for source code, in reality, there are many other
							entities within an information solution to which version control
							can and where practical be applied. This is especially true if
							those entities are stored within text-based files or if they can
							be exported to and imported from text-based files (e.g.,
							configuration settings stored in a database). These additional
							entities include but are not necessarily limited to the
							following:</p>


						<ul style="padding-left: 20px">
							<li style="list-style-type: circle">configuration settings
								(.conf, .cfg, .ini, etc.)</li>
							<li style="list-style-type: circle">templates (e.g., web
								page layouts, forms, etc.)</li>
							<li style="list-style-type: circle">rules (e.g., access,
								permissions, processing, filtering, scheduling, etc.)</li>
							<li style="list-style-type: circle">shared inclusions (e.g.,
								headers, footers, menus, etc.)</li>
							<li style="list-style-type: circle">documentation (e.g.,
								technical specs, user guides, operations guides, etc.)</li>

						<h2>Background</h2>
						<p align="justify">It is extremely rare if not impossible for
							a developer to work on a single file, in isolation, without
							sharing it with the outside world. Version Control (also known as
							revision control, source control, or source code management)
							provides a logical way to organize and control changes to various
							versions of files.</p>

						<h3 style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px">Brief
							History</h3>
						<p align="justify" style="padding-top: 0px">The first Version
							Control Systems were introduced in 1972 by Bell Labs. The first
							one was available only for UNIX and only worked with Source Code
							files. It only worked on the development system and was not made
							for sharing code, as it only worked for a single user. In 2000, a
							new product called Subversion was created and supported non-text
							files, tracking directory structure changes, such as file renames
							and moves, and its transaction unit was the directory as opposed
							to an individual file. So you could check in an entire directory
							tree and check it out. In 2004, Microsoft created the Team
							Foundation Server to replace its aging Visual SourceSafe Version
							Control System, which was primarily a client server system. The
							next generation of source code control software is called
							Distributed Source Code Control. Distributed Source Code Control
							is different in that there's not a central server that everybody
							shares. Everybody shares their own individual repository and then
							can share their changes with a central server or share their
							changes with individual users.</p>

						<h2 style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px">Concepts
							in Version Control</h2>
						<h3>Centralized Vs Distributed Version Control</h3>
						<img src="assets/img/version-control-management/centralized.png"
							style="float: left; width: 500px; height: 400px">
						<p>
							<b>Centralized Version Control Systems</b> (such as CVS,
							Subversion, and Perforce) have a single server that contains all
							the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files
							from that central place. For many years, this has been the
							standard for version control. This setup offers many advantages,
							especially over local VCSs. For example, everyone knows to a
							certain degree what everyone else on the project is doing.
							Administrators have fine-grained control over who can do what,
							and it’s far easier to administer a CVCS than it is to deal with
							local databases on every client. However, this setup also has
							some serious downsides. The most obvious is the single point of
							failure that the centralized server represents. If that server
							goes down for an hour, then during that hour nobody can
							collaborate at all or save versioned changes to anything they’re
							working on. If the hard disk the central database is on becomes
							corrupted, and proper backups haven’t been kept, you lose
							absolutely everything — the entire history of the project except
							whatever single snapshots people happen to have on their local
							machines. Local VCS systems suffer from this same problem —
							whenever you have the entire history of the project in a single
							place, you risk losing everything.
						</p>
						<br> <img
							src="assets/img/version-control-management/distributed.png"
							style="float: right; width: 500px; height: 400px">
						<p>
							<b>Distributed Version Control Systems</b> (DVCSs) steps in to
							take care of the above risk associated with the Centralized
							approach. In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs),
							clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files;
							rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full
							history. Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were
							collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can
							be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is
							really a full backup of all the data. Furthermore, many of these
							systems deal pretty well with having several remote repositories
							they can work with, so you can collaborate with different groups
							of people in different ways simultaneously within the same
							project. This allows you to set up several types of workflows
							that aren’t possible in centralized systems, such as hierarchical
							models.

						<li>
							<p align="justify">Tracking changes in the document over time

						<li>
							<p align="justify">To work only on a particular version of a
								document, e.g. client has requested changes in 1.x version of
								software ABC, then only the documents corresponding to version
								1.x such as SRS, SAD, source code, will be required to change</p>

						<li>
							<p align="justify">Experimenting with source code without
								disturbing existing working code, e.g. RnD teams are required to
								work on various versions of the given software, without
								disturbing the working copy, moreover, they need to maintain
								each version of their work to support their research and as
